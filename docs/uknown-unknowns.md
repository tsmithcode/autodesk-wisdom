# 🧠 The Principle of "I Don’t Know What I Don’t Know"  
_Also known as: Unknown Unknowns_  
**Framed for Autodesk Developers and Architects**

---

## 🎓 What It Means

In the discipline of systems architecture and CAD automation, the most dangerous risks are rarely the ones we’re aware of—they are the blind spots we do not know exist.

> “The absence of a question is not the absence of a problem.”

This principle—popularized by decision theorists and systems engineers—refers to **unconscious ignorance**: critical gaps in understanding that exist **outside our current frame of inquiry**.

## 🧬 Why It Matters in Autodesk Work

As a CAD developer or architect, you may unknowingly:
- Trigger unstable geometry from a template built under different units.
- Use a plugin that fails silently under localized folder structures.
- Assume Vault retains drawing state post-check-in, when it doesn’t.

These aren’t “bugs”—they are the **invisible cracks in your model of reality**.

## 🛠 How to Work With It

### 1. **Conduct Retrospectives for Surprises**
Create a “Surprises” section in project debriefs:
- What failed unexpectedly?
- What did we learn we never even thought to ask?

### 2. **Design for Discovery**
- Add verbose logs with unexpected state capture.
- Don’t just validate inputs—log what *you didn’t expect* to receive.

### 3. **Involve Cross-Disciplinary Users**
- Ask power users, production engineers, and purchasers to test your tools.
- Their usage patterns often break assumptions you weren’t aware you made.

### 4. **Track Open Questions as Blind Spots**
Maintain an `unknowns.md` in your project root. Example entries:
```plaintext
- Do all AutoCAD versions interpret this block scale identically?
- What happens to parameter constraints in mirrored parts?
- Does Inventor’s API return correct values when file is in read-only Vault state?

5. Use Controlled Chaos to Probe Assumptions
	•	Load intentionally malformed files.
	•	Run automation scripts with missing metadata.
	•	Simulate low-permission users in shared environments.

This reveals what your architecture assumes—but never tested.

🧭 Mental Shift

Treat “I don’t know what I don’t know” not as a sign of incompetence, but as a source of exploration and maturity.

⸻

🧠 Add to Your Workflow

Create a new document in each major project:

/project-name/docs/unknowns.md

Include:
	•	Assumptions
	•	Open questions
	•	Discovered blind spots
	•	Suggestions for future investigation

Use this as a checkpoint before finalizing automation logic or plugin packaging.
