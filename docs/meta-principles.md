Excellent angle. In addition to first principles and continuous improvement, meta-principles like the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) help Autodesk developers and architects prioritize high-leverage actions. Here’s a focused list of non-redundant, practical “meta-principles” that complement and elevate your technical design principles:

🎯 Meta-Principles for High-Leverage Autodesk Development

These are not coding rules—they’re thinking tools that guide where, why, and how to spend effort for maximum impact.

⸻

1. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

“20% of features or scripts solve 80% of user problems.”

	•	Identify the few plugins, macros, or templates used most frequently and optimize those first.
	•	Apply it to bugs: 20% of geometry problems likely cause 80% of ticket volume.

⸻

2. Gall’s Law

“A complex system that works evolved from a simple system that worked.”

	•	Don’t over-architect a solution at the start. Build a small plugin or script that solves one problem well, then expand.
	•	Start with a working title block updater before building full drawing governance automation.

⸻

3. The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent vs Important)

“Not everything urgent is important. Not everything important is urgent.”

	•	Prioritize long-term improvements (e.g., drawing standardization, Forge migration) alongside daily tasks.
	•	Avoid putting out fires endlessly—fix root causes.

⸻

4. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)

“Don’t code for use cases that don’t exist.”

	•	Avoid premature abstraction. Don’t support 12 belt configurations if only 3 are used 95% of the time.
	•	Build for today’s actual workflows; optimize when scale demands it.

⸻

5. Law of Diminishing Returns

“The first 80% of performance gains are easy—the last 20% may not be worth it.”

	•	If a drawing automation already saves 15 minutes per use, don’t spend 3 weeks shaving off 5 more seconds.
	•	Know when to stop polishing and move to the next high-leverage task.

⸻

6. Second-Order Thinking

“What happens next, and then after that?”

	•	Example: Automating a drawing’s export saves time—but does it affect BOM accuracy, Vault check-ins, or purchasing logic?
	•	Think beyond the immediate output. Consider downstream effects of every system change.

⸻

7. Opportunity Cost

“Doing this means not doing something else—so is it worth it?”

	•	Is rewriting a part placement rule worth more than implementing revision control?
	•	Frame every architectural decision as a trade-off of limited time and focus.

⸻

8. Minimum Effective Dose

“What’s the smallest change that gives the biggest benefit?”

	•	Don’t refactor a plugin—just add a missing validation if that solves 90% of support requests.
	•	When improving templates, start with high-visibility fixes (e.g. units, BOM clarity).

⸻

9. Parkinson’s Law

“Work expands to fill the time available.”

	•	Give CAD automation projects fixed durations with a clear MVP.
	•	If a drawing automation has no timeline, it may never ship.

⸻

10. Hanlon’s Razor

“Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance or oversight.”

	•	If users misuse your plugin or break constraints, they probably don’t understand it—not trying to ruin your system.
	•	Improve training, documentation, or error messages instead of blaming users.
