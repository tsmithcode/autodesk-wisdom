Absolutely. Below are non-redundant, high-impact continuous improvement principles specifically tailored to an Autodesk developer or architect working in CAD automation, plugin development, and system design.

🔄 Continuous Improvement Principles for Autodesk Developers / Architects

Each principle complements the others—no duplication, just distinct levers for getting better over time.

⸻

1. Measure Before You Modify

“Improvement starts with visibility.”

	•	Track drawing generation time, revision counts, user clicks, or rework cycles.
	•	Benchmark automation tools before and after each iteration.
	•	Use metrics to justify CAD changes to leadership.

⸻

2. Refactor with a Purpose

“Don’t refactor for elegance—refactor for leverage.”

	•	Only improve code when doing so increases reuse, clarity, or extensibility.
	•	Use plugin audits and code reviews to schedule meaningful refactor sessions.
	•	Prioritize high-traffic or high-impact tools.

3. Audit the Forgotten

“The most costly errors hide in legacy macros, templates, and config files.”

	•	Review old iLogic rules, template files, and drawing sheets quarterly.
	•	Set aside time to clean up unused parameters, broken references, and outdated scripts.
	•	Legacy tech debt in CAD is often invisible until it breaks something important.

4. Document Insights While Fresh

“Good notes today are exponential value tomorrow.”

	•	After solving tricky API bugs or geometry quirks, write a one-paragraph summary.
	•	Keep a /lessons-learned folder in your repo or Notion.
	•	Future-you (or your successor) will thank you.

⸻

5. Automate What You Repeat Twice

“Every repetitive CAD task is a candidate for automation or templating.”

	•	If you do it more than twice manually, it deserves a button or a script.
	•	Save time with scripts for title blocks, BOM extraction, file renaming, view placements, etc.
	•	Document one-click macros with intent, not just code.

⸻

6. Gather User Feedback as a Signal

“Every user complaint is a data point—track them.”

	•	Create a simple feedback loop: form, email, sticky note, or embedded UI prompt.
	•	Distinguish between technical bugs and UX confusion—both matter.
	•	Adjust backlog priorities based on frequency and severity of pain points.

⸻

7. Limit Unnecessary Complexity

“Elegant design beats clever tricks.”

	•	Prefer stable constraints over overengineered formulas.
	•	Break up complex features into smaller, testable components.
	•	The more complex a drawing or script, the harder it is to debug or reuse.

⸻

8. Practice Versioned Rollouts

“Don’t replace workflows—introduce new versions alongside the old.”

	•	Always release changes with a rollback or fallback plan.
	•	Tag versions (V1, V2, etc.) and use release notes even for internal tools.
	•	Let users migrate gradually to prevent panic.

⸻

9. Continuously Expand Your Pattern Library

“Templates and snippets should evolve with your skills.”

	•	Keep a curated folder of reusable design patterns (e.g., view creator, dimension standardizer, BOM exporter).
	•	Regularly improve these tools with each new learning or API discovery.
	•	This becomes your internal CAD SDK.

⸻

10. Schedule Time for “CAD R&D”

“Not all value is billable—exploration breeds innovation.”

	•	Dedicate weekly or bi-weekly blocks for experimentation: new API, data export, 3D parametric trick.
	•	Use sandbox files, not production models.
	•	Some of your best tools will come from structured play.
