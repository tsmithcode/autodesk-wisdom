## 🔥 Guiding Principles

1. **Abstraction Over Repetition** – Build once, reuse often.
2. **Context-Driven Design** – Code that understands user behavior and system constraints.
3. **Precision & Idempotence** – Every design must be geometrically stable and repeatable.
4. **Systemic Thinking** – From CAD button to BOM to shop floor, everything is connected.
5. **Documentation as a Feature** – Great tools explain themselves.
